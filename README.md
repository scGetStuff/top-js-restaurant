The Odin Project, Full Stack JavaScript Path, JavaScript, Organizing your JavaScript Code, Project: Restaurant Page

The goal of this project is to generate the website from JavaScript; "practicing DOM manipulation".
A single `<div id="content"></div>` tag in the html, css is done normally.

The course covered the mechanics of using npm and webpack, but provided nothing as to how to structure the code.
No conventions on size or content of a module; how should the app be split up?
Also, static style seems wrong.  In other code I've seen they are supposed to be local to a component.
This project seems to have us practicing bad form.

I'm just stubbing things out, not fleshing out made up details; I want to get to back-end work.

Done for now, I may circle back later once I have more info.
